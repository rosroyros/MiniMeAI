# Project Updates

## Timestamp Normalization Project - 2025-03-21

### Initial Problem
- The document collection had inconsistent timestamp handling
- Approximately 30% of documents lacked timestamps
- Some documents also lacked source type attribution

### Solution Implementation

#### 1. Created and improved scripts for timestamp handling
- Developed `normalize_timestamps.py` to add timestamps to documents with dates
- Fixed the timestamp extraction algorithm to work with various date formats
- Added error handling and verbose logging for better diagnostics
- Implemented batch processing to efficiently update documents

#### 2. Enhanced the vector database API
- Created a new endpoint for updating document metadata
- Fixed an issue with metadata merging (previous implementation was replacing instead of merging)
- Improved error handling and success reporting

#### 3. Standardized source type handling
- Created a `BaseFetcher` abstract class in `utils/base_fetcher.py`
- Implemented consistent source type attribution and timestamp normalization
- Updated the `EmailFetcher` to inherit from `BaseFetcher`
- Created the `timing.py` utility for performance monitoring
- Added detailed documentation in `README_FETCHERS.md`

#### 4. Deployed and tested the changes
- Ran the normalization script multiple times to process all documents
- Updated Docker configurations and container files
- Verified the solutions worked through timestamp analysis reports

### Results
- Successfully normalized timestamps for 100% of documents (up from ~70%)
- Applied consistent timestamp formatting across all documents
- Improved the source type architecture to ensure all future documents will have proper attribution
- Added a solid foundation for adding new data sources with consistent metadata

### Architecture Improvements
- Created a more maintainable and extensible data fetcher system
- Standardized metadata fields across all document types
- Implemented consistent error handling and logging
- Added utilities for monitoring performance and debugging issues
