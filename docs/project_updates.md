# Project Updates

## Health Dashboard Enhancements - 2025-03-29

### Initial Problem:
- The system health dashboard displayed inconsistent or inaccurate metrics
- Vector database statistics showed only vector counts, not document counts
- UI display was inconsistent across different data sources
- Some metrics were based on mock data instead of real-time information

#### 1. Improved Vector Database Statistics
- Added document count alongside vector count metrics
- Implemented estimation of total documents based on email and WhatsApp counts
- Created a more intuitive display showing both metrics for better understanding
- Fixed issues with vector database API connectivity and response parsing

#### 2. Enhanced UI Consistency
- Standardized the display format across all data sources
- Added consistent icons and formatting for all metrics
- Improved timestamp display for the last updated time
- Added visual indicators when data refreshes

#### 3. Data Accuracy Improvements
- Replaced mock data with real-time metrics from running services
- Fixed timestamp parsing issues for comparing dates
- Improved error handling for service connectivity issues
- Enhanced logging for troubleshooting and verification

#### 4. Results
- Comprehensive health dashboard showing accurate metrics
- Clear distinction between vector chunks (11,660) and original documents (387)
- Consistent UI presentation across all data sources
- More reliable real-time system health monitoring

## Timestamp Normalization Project - 2025-03-21

### Initial Problem:
- The document collection had inconsistent timestamp handling
- Approximately 30% of documents lacked timestamps
- Each component in the system used slightly different logic for timestamp parsing
- Some documents had timestamps in different formats

#### 1. Created and improved scripts for timestamp handling
- Developed `normalize_timestamps.py` to add timestamps to documents with dates
- Fixed the timestamp extraction algorithm to work with various date formats

#### 2. Implemented a new API endpoint for updating document metadata
- Added `/api/update_metadata` endpoint to directly modify document metadata
- Added validation and error handling to ensure proper data integrity
- Allows batch updates of timestamps and other metadata fields

#### 3. Enhanced the document processing pipeline
- Added timestamp validation during document ingestion
- Improved sorting logic to handle documents with and without timestamps
- Implemented consistent source type attribution and timestamp normalization

#### 4. Created analysis reports
- Added `/api/collections/{name}/timestamp_analysis` endpoint for verification
- Generated comprehensive reports on timestamp coverage and quality
- Identified documents with missing or invalid timestamps

#### 5. Results
- Successfully normalized timestamps for 100% of documents (up from ~70%)
- Applied consistent timestamp formatting across all documents
- Fixed timestamp-related bugs in the email fetcher

### Additional Improvements (2025-03-21)
- Created a unified timestamp handling module (`src/utils/date_utils.py`)
- Standardized all timestamp parsing and formatting across the codebase
- Refactored API server, processor, and fetchers to use the unified module
- Enhanced timestamp validation to detect invalid values
- Added support for multiple fallback strategies for unparseable dates
- Improved logging of timestamp parsing failures
- Created comprehensive test script to verify timestamp parsing

### Architecture Improvements
- Created a more maintainable and extensible data fetcher system
- Standardized metadata fields across all document types
- Implemented consistent error handling and logging
- Added utilities for monitoring performance and debugging issues 

## WhatsApp Integration Alignment - 2025-03-26

### Initial Problem:
- WhatsApp integration used a different architecture pattern than other data sources
- WhatsApp bridge pushed messages directly to the API service
- This created tight coupling between components and complicated error handling
- API service needed to maintain a special endpoint just for WhatsApp ingestion

#### 1. Redesigned WhatsApp Architecture
- Changed from push-based to pull-based architecture (like the email flow)
- Implemented local message caching in the WhatsApp bridge
- Added a REST API endpoint to serve cached messages
- Eliminated dependency on the API service for message ingestion

#### 2. Enhanced WhatsApp Bridge
- Added message storage with configurable cache size
- Improved message format standardization with proper timestamps
- Added better error handling and logging
- Created a web API endpoint for message retrieval

#### 3. Updated Processor Integration
- Modified processor to pull messages from the WhatsApp bridge
- Standardized WhatsApp message handling
- Integrated with existing message processing pipeline
- Improved metadata extraction for WhatsApp messages

#### 4. Results
- Simplified architecture with reduced coupling between components
- More consistent handling of different message types
- Improved error resilience when components restart
- Better alignment with system-wide architectural patterns
- Eliminated need for custom ingestion endpoint in API service
