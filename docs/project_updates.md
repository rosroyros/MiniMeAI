# Project Updates

## Timestamp Normalization Project - 2025-03-21

### Initial Problem:
- The document collection had inconsistent timestamp handling
- Approximately 30% of documents lacked timestamps
- Each component in the system used slightly different logic for timestamp parsing
- Some documents had timestamps in different formats

#### 1. Created and improved scripts for timestamp handling
- Developed `normalize_timestamps.py` to add timestamps to documents with dates
- Fixed the timestamp extraction algorithm to work with various date formats

#### 2. Implemented a new API endpoint for updating document metadata
- Added `/api/update_metadata` endpoint to directly modify document metadata
- Added validation and error handling to ensure proper data integrity
- Allows batch updates of timestamps and other metadata fields

#### 3. Enhanced the document processing pipeline
- Added timestamp validation during document ingestion
- Improved sorting logic to handle documents with and without timestamps
- Implemented consistent source type attribution and timestamp normalization

#### 4. Created analysis reports
- Added `/api/collections/{name}/timestamp_analysis` endpoint for verification
- Generated comprehensive reports on timestamp coverage and quality
- Identified documents with missing or invalid timestamps

#### 5. Results
- Successfully normalized timestamps for 100% of documents (up from ~70%)
- Applied consistent timestamp formatting across all documents
- Fixed timestamp-related bugs in the email fetcher

### Additional Improvements (2025-03-21)
- Created a unified timestamp handling module (`src/utils/date_utils.py`)
- Standardized all timestamp parsing and formatting across the codebase
- Refactored API server, processor, and fetchers to use the unified module
- Enhanced timestamp validation to detect invalid values
- Added support for multiple fallback strategies for unparseable dates
- Improved logging of timestamp parsing failures
- Created comprehensive test script to verify timestamp parsing

### Architecture Improvements
- Created a more maintainable and extensible data fetcher system
- Standardized metadata fields across all document types
- Implemented consistent error handling and logging
- Added utilities for monitoring performance and debugging issues
